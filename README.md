## Reactivity

Reactivity is an open-source WEB application offering a visual way to manage your activity in a reactive manner.

## Motivations

Today people a working in a distributed environment.
They are interracting with collaborators not co-located, dealing with different sources of data that are connected together all around the world.
The need to build a visual organization of that activity ready to react to any change from any source becomes a must to stay productive.

We believe in a reactive WEB application which helps people to view the activity that matters.
This application can be freely installed by anyone and is integrated with a lot of reliable open source products to achieve its mission.
By adopting the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) standard, the application is ready to scale with a few resources to face an unpredictible increase of the live data volume.

This is what Reactivity is and why we want to build it.

## Status of the project

The project is in an embryonic state.
We are designing the first UX as well as technical fundations based on the Javascript and JVM ecosystems.
No milestone and backlog is still defined.
Also all contribution rules and tools to use are open issues.
Anyone is welcome to join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/myxit/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) and contribute to the design phase.
